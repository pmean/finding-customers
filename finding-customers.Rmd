## Abstract

If you want to set up your own consulting business, you need to get the word out to potential customers. This webinar will compare and contrast the traditional approaches (such as giving talks and volunteering) to “old school” Internet (such as websites and email newsletters) to social media (such as Facebook and Twitter). 

<div class="notes">

I won't read this whole abstract, but to get customers, you have to get "known." And getting known can be done with traditional approaches, old school internet, and social media.

</div>

## Abstract (continued)

The key to all three approaches is that you give away small samples of what you know for free to establish your credibility and build up a network of contacts.

<div class="notes">

The commonality of all these approaches is that they are free from a money standpoint, but do require an investment of time.

</div>

## The best way to find customers

![](images/word-of-mouth.png)

<div class="notes">

By far the best way to find new customers is the "word of mouth." People want to hire someone that they know and trust. If they don't have anyone, they will ask an acquaintance or colleague who they know and trust. You want be the first person that this acquaintance or colleague thinks of when they are asked this question.

</div>

## Spread the word, everyone is a potential referral source

* Your alma mater

* At the job you're leaving.

* Current customers (if you have them)

* Other statisticians

<div class="notes">

You will find that people from all sorts of places will end up recommending you. Don't miss a chance to let people know you are in the consulting business.

</div>

## Spreading the word, at your alma mater

* Faculty

* Fellow students

* Satisfy their natural curiosity

* "Staying in touch" emails

<div class="notes">

Your biggest supporters will be the faculty at the school where you got your degree. Your success makes them look better.

Your fellow students will disperse like dandelion seeds on the wind. They will meet lots of people and some of them might be your future clients.

Both groups will be naturally curious and will not at all mind hearing about this new career you're starting in consulting.

You should also find a way to stay in regular touch with them.

</div>

## Spreading the word, at the job you're leaving

* Satisfy their natural curiosity.

* Do encourage them to recommend you.

* Don't poach.

* "Staying in touch" emails.

<div class="notes">

If you're leaving your old job on a good note, take advantage of the good will that you will have. Your . You have an opportunity to talk at length about your new career. Tell them about the clients you already have lined up and the types of clients that you are hoping to get.

It's okay to ask for recommendations, but beware of poaching (stealing business from your old company). Look for a "non-compete" clause in your hiring contract.

</div>

## Spreading the word, with your current customers

You may already have a few customers in the queue. If you do, take advantage of them as possible referral sources.

* At the first session

* One week/one month after completion

* "Staying in touch" emails

* Ask for repeat business.

<div class="notes">

When you get a new customer, ask how they heard about you. If it was from an acquantance, send that person a thank you note.

Wait a short time after completing your final report. "Just following up. Are you still happy with my work? Do you know anyone else who might want to hire me?"

Find an excuse every month or so to send a "staying in touch" email. I'll give some examples a bit later in this talk.

Less frequently, you might ask how things are going and if there is anything new that you might be able to help with.

</div>

## Spreading the word, with your fellow statisticians

Your fellow statisticians might send you business because

* they can't consult,

* they don't want to consult,

* they want to consult, but not for this client.

<div class="notes">

You should never think of other statisticians as competing for your business. For me, they have been a regular source of referrals. They might not be able to consult themselves because of job restrictions, but they still want to help them out (and you at the same time). 

Even if they are in the business themselves, they may not feel qualified to handle a particular problem.

Or they might not like a particular type of client. I get a lot of referrals for PhD candidates who need a bit of help for their dissertation. Their committee needs to okay my involvement, but usually both they and the candidate are happy to get some help. Ph.D. candidates are a poor revenue source (they have short-term needs and are unlikely to provide repeat business). But I still like working with them, and appreciate anyone who can send these types of clients my way.

</div>

## Promoting yourself without 

![](images/spam_can.png)

<div class="notes">

There's a fine line between self-promotion and spamming. Keep yourself on the proper side by considering

* timing (when and how often)

* relevancy (is there something of value to them?)

* restraint (keep it short and sweet)

</div>

## Introductions or re-introductions

* Mention the word "consultant" but otherwise keep it short.

* Wait for them to ask for more details.

<div class="notes">

When I introduce myself: "I have three jobs. I work part-time in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics at UMKC. I am supported on a grant with Enterprise Analytics at KUMC. I'm also an independent statistical consultant."

If you get an inquiring response, tell them about the types of clients you have, or the types of analyses you do. Keep it short and sweet, again. "Most of my clients are Ph.D. candidates. I handle just about anyone: education, psychology, social work, just to name a few."

</div>

## Simple email settings.

![](images/email-settings.png)

<div class="notes">

Getting the word out could be as simple as putting the name of your consulting company in your email name or in your signature file. Avoid a long signature file.

</div>

## "Just staying in touch" emails.

An occasional email from you helps keep you in the forefront of the thoughts of faculty, fellow students, old co-workers, and old clients.

* Find something of value to them and share it.

* Infrequent, but regular.

<div class="notes">

Always keep an eye open for interesting stuff: articles, websites, news. Send it along with a comment like "I saw this and thought of you." or "This is an interesting analysis that is similar to what we worked on."

Do this monthly or less frequently, but do it regularly. Don't ask directly for referrals. Think of it as a way to make yourself unforgettable.

</div>

## Business cards

* Always have a business card available to hand out.

* Gratefully accept and business cards you get.

* Write a few words on the back

* Follow up at least once with a brief email.

<div class="notes">

Keep a stack of business cards handy that mention that you are a consultant and that provides contact information, such as mailing address, phone number, email, and website. Aslo mention, if you have them, your Twitter handle, LinkedIn account, etc. 

Before you hand your business card to someone, write a few words on the back and write a brief note to yourself on the back of any card you get. This will remind them and you of the context in which the cards were exchanged.

You should also remember that no one who gives you a business card can complain if you send one email to them, so make a point of saying something short and sweet within a few days receiving their card. Remind them again of the context in which you exchanged cards and offer them something of value, if you can.

"I enjoyed chatting with you at the R Users Group. I wanted to share a copy of the paper where I talk about the new R package that I wrote."

</div>



## Expanding the number of people who know you

If you can find a way to become famous, you will get a lot more referrals.

* Traditional approaches

* "Old school" internet

* Social media (Web 2.0)

<div class="notes">

While taking advantage of faculty, fellow students, co-workers, etc. is a good idea, you also want to get your name out among people who don't know you.

There are several easy things you can do that can help make you famous. These can be broadly classified into traditional (non-Interent) approaches, old school Internet, and new school Internet, commonly called social media or Web 2.0.

All of these approaches cost next to nothing, but they are labor intensive.

</div>

## Traditional approaches

You don't need an Internet presence to become well known.

* Talking

* Writing

* Volunteering

<div class="notes">

People became famous before the Internet came along. They didn't need to "friend" several hundred people. They didn't need have their tweets retweeted. They didn't have to go viral.

You can promote yourself the old fashioned way, by talking, writing, and volunteering.

If you know something, talk about it. Talk at statistics gatherings, because fellow statisticians are a great referral source. But also talk before groups who might be potential clients.

Write up a brief introduction that you can offer to the person introducing you. Make sure it includes the fact that you are a consultant.

Writing articles is also a good way to get known, and the articles don't have to be peer-reviewed. Write for places that might be read by your fellow statisticians, but write for places read by potential clients.

Volunteering is another way to enhance your visibility. I am currently the President of the Kansas City R Users Group, and people make the assumption that someone with that title must know more about R than anyone else in the Kansas City area. This is most definitely not true, but I will not disabuse anyone of that false assumption.

Don't volunteer for something and then do a lousy job. You'll get a lot of negative publicity.

</div>

## "Old school" Internet

Applications of Internet technologies developed in the prior century. Largely considered obsolete, but still valuable.

* Email newsletters

* Email discussion groups

* Web sites

<div class="notes">

Even though everyone talks about the latest social media application, the "old school" Internet technologies: email and the World Wide Web are still useful tools.

An email newsletter provides a regular set of short articles distributed by email. Be sure to spend a bit of money on a professional vendor of email distribution software (Emma, Constant Contact). The well-known name, the opt-in subscription page, and the standard footer allowing unsubscription will help you avoid the perception that you are spamming people. 

There are many interesting email discussion groups, though these have to some extent been supplanted by web based discussion groups like Stack Overflow, but they still work the same way. Find a group where you can both ask and answer questions. A group where you only ask questions won't help you establish your authority. A group where you only answer questions will seem tedious after a while.

A static website is also very helpful. It can be as simple as a single page with contact information. Think of it as an electronic version of your business card.

## Web 2.0

The hallmark of social media/Web 2.0 is a much higher degree of interactivity.

* Facebook

* LinkedIn

* Twitter

* Many others.

Pick a primary area and use other areas to supplement your primary area.

<div class="notes">

If you're confused by Web 2.0, I am too. It is a hectic game of musical chairs (is Google+ going to replace Facebook?) and every new Web 2.0 tool touts its special unique features. In essence, Web 2.0 refers to a class of new tools for creating and sharing information on the Internet. Web 2.0 offers relative ease in creating and publishing information. Web 2.0 also makes it easy for others to comment on and enhance the material that you publish.


Around the turn of the century, the Internet got a lot more interactive, and you will find communities that develop content collectively rather than a solo author putting up a series of articles.

These new approaches offer a sense of immediacy, but I find that they, at the same time, offer a lack of permanence. But lots of people have gotten good mileage out of these social media sites.

There is a lot of insipid stuff on social media, but that should not scare you away. A lot of people are using social media effectively to make a name for themselves and to promote their works.

Your goal, whether using Web 2.0 or more traditional approaches, is to build a level of familiarity with your potential customers. People don't like to hire total strangers. Sometimes they will but it is very scary. If someone knows you because they read your blog regularly, or because they follow your Twitter feeds, that reduces the fear factor somewhat.

</div>

## I like blogging

My recommendation for a primary area to promote your consulting business is a blog.

* Built in tools for tagging, searching

* Indexed by Google

* More interactive than a website

<div class="notes">

I like blogging and I see that this is one of the best approaches to get some recognition. A blog requires regular work. Make a commitment: one post every other day or two per month. The frequency is not as important as the regularity. Don't do a flurry of posts and then burn out.

If you are early in your career, you may have difficulty with writing good content for your blog. Don't let this stop you. An easy, and very valuable thing that anyone, even a beginner can do is to recommend interesting resources. Include a brief summary in your own words so people know what they are clicking on. Do this often enough in one area and you will have a very nice electronic version of an annotated bibliography.

</div>

## Develop a focus

Whatever you choose, try to make your work stand out.

* Raynauld Levesque

* Michael Chernick

<div class="notes">

Raynauld Levesque found an underserved niche when he developed a website about SPSS (http://www.spsstools.net). It wasn't a general site about SPSS, but rather a site about syntax and macros in SPSS. His site became to "go to" site for the really tough problems in SPSS that required macro solutions. Other people started contributing macros to his site. What a wonderful success you have achieved when your site gets fresh content from your readers.

Michael Chernick developed a different niche. He produced reviews of Statistics textbooks for Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/AQ7ZQWXAYT8HZ). He has reviewed over 600 books and his reviews are always informative. It's impossible to look on Amazon for advanced applications in Statistics without repeatedly seeing his name next to a detailed review.


If you're confused by Web 2.0, I am too. It is a hectic game of musical chairs (is Google+ going to replace Facebook?) and every new Web 2.0 tool touts its special unique features. In essence, Web 2.0 refers to a class of new tools for creating and sharing information on the Internet. Web 2.0 offers relative ease in creating and publishing information. Web 2.0 also makes it easy for others to comment on and enhance the material that you publish.

Don't let the many insipid uses of Web 2.0 tools keep you away. Sure you can be like everyone else and keep tabs on what Paris Hilton is having for breakfast. But even if most of Web 2.0 is vain and self-indulgent, you can still find much of value here.

Blogging software is the simplest example of a Web 2.0 application, and it is a very good starting point if you want to try out Web 2.0. A blog provides a straightforward way to create content, much easier than building a website from scratch. The blogging software can handle formatting and indexing for you. Some blogs even allow you to add new entries by email.  Most importantly, a blog (unlike a static website) offers your readers a chance to comment on what you've written. This is a double-edged sword, but it is mostly good.

I like to think of other Web 2.0 tools as variations on a blog (Twitter, in fact, is called a micro-blogging site). So everything I say about a blog applies just as well to other Web 2.0 tools. But these Web 2.0 tools do offer important features beyond a blog. The most common extra feature is the ability to create or join communities of people with similar interests. This is useful for your professional development (e.g., getting your data mining questions answered on a data mining group on LinkedIn) but if you regularly provide useful  resources for others as well, you develop an aura of expertise and you build up your name recognition. Whatever Web 2.0 tool you use, keep these three adjectives in mind: focused, fresh, and fun.

Focused. Think carefully about what you will blog about. A wide ranging blog about anything and everything is likely to be too diffuse to be of interest. It will also be difficult to build up a critical mass of content when you tackle too broad a range of topics.

Focus is good, but where should you place your focus? Pick something that helps establish your credibility as an expert in a particular area, of course, but more importantly, find an under-served niche. There are 393 R bloggers (www.r-bloggers.com), so you won't get much notice if you become the 394th blogger. If you must blog about R, pick a specialization within R, such as GIS applications, or you'll get lost in the crowd.

Focus also applies to the Web 2.0 tools that you choose to use. Select one tool as your primary focus and if you use others, use them mostly to supplement and support that primary focus. So, for example, focus mostly on a blog and use Twitter to update people when a new blog post appears. Or focus on Twitter, and use your blog as an archive for your tweets. There are many tools that help you update multiple Web 2.0 sites simultaneously. LinkedIn, for example, offers you the option of sharing updates on Twitter as well. But even with this type of assistance, you run the risk of spreading yourself too thinly.

Fresh. You need to provide regular entries. It doesn't matter whether you write every other day or every other week, but make the commitment to update on a regular and predictable pattern. Don't start out too fast. You'll burn yourself out, but you'll also raise a level of expectation from your readers that you won't be able to maintain. Freshness is even more critical for Facebook and Twitter. Old posts and tweets fade into the background more quickly than a blog entry would. If you can't make the commitment to visit a Web 2.0 site and update things regularly, leave that site off your list entirely rather than make a half-hearted effort.

Your Web 2.0 entries can be original content, or they can be commentary on other resources. If you write your own original content, keep it short and sweet, both for your sake and for the sake of your readers. This is a free sample, and if you spend all your time on blog entries, you won't have time for your paying customers. Also, people who go looking for your content on the web aren't usually interested in a lengthy dissertation. Write enough to do the topic justice, but no more.

If you provide commentary on other resources, do take the time to add something more descriptive than "Hey look at this interesting website I just found." No one likes to click on a link without first getting a hint as to what they will see when they reach that site.

For commentary, Facebook does an even better job than a blog because it automatically includes a thumbnail of one of the graphic images from the web page you are linking to. Better still, your Facebook posts will also include your picture (be sure you have a good Facebook picture). Repeated reminders of what you look like goes a long way to making people more comfortable with who you are.

You should also consider using Web 2.0 tools to aggregate other people's content. The Internet is a huge place, and you can provide a great service by providing a "one stop shopping" spot for your readers. I come across Statistics events in the Kansas City area (ASA chapter meetings, local university seminars, R and SAS user group events, etc.) from a variety of sources and I was constantly losing track of what was happening when. Partly for my own benefit, but also for others, I set up a web page (http://www.pmean.com/kcstats.html) with general contact information for each group and announcements of upcoming events. With a bit of work, I could set up a reminder tweets that would provide notice 24 hours in advance of these events.

Twitter gets a lot of criticism for the 140 character limit, and it clearly is not the Web 2.0 tool for expounding on the recent advances in hierarchical models. But for simple announcements (like KC stats events), it is an excellent choice. Tweets are easily followed on your smartphone, an ideal platform for this type of information.
Fun. Make your blog fun for you and it will become fun for your readers. Make sure that you have some passion for what you are writing about. If it seems like a chore, you won't have enough motivation to contribute regularly and your readers will pick up on your tone.

This applies double for the Web 2.0 tools that you choose to use. Don't use Web 2.0 tools that you find annoying. Twitter is wildly popular, but if you chafe at its 140 character limit, dump Twitter. Facebook and LinkedIn have their competing partisans and if you find yourself taking sides, that's okay. Some people love the informality of Facebook and cringe at the stodgy nature of LinkedIn. Others find Facebook to be vapid and self-centered and prefer the professional demeanor of LinkedIn. Use what you're comfortable with and ignore anything else. Just because you adopt one Web 2.0 tool does not mean you are obligated to recreate a similar presence on all the other Web 2.0 tools.

Talk directly to your readers. You should try as much as possible to use the pronoun "you" rather than the pronoun "I" or the dreaded passive voice. Your blog is not the place to establish an aura of objectivity by adopting an encyclopedic tone.

Encourage your readers to talk back to you. Part of the value of a blog is that your readers can post comments on your blog posts. This can be scary, but these comments can add great value. Your readers  will feel a better emotional connection to you and see you as more as a colleague and peer. Stay vigilant, though, and remove off-topic or off-color responses. Bad commentary will reflect poorly on you.

Some people advocate keeping your personal life separate from your professional life, but I think it works to your advantage to share a little bit about yourself, your family, your hobbies, and your travels. It tends to humanize you and make you seem less of a stranger. Don't flood Facebook with hundreds of pictures of your cute dog, though. Your true friends will endure this and even pretend that they adore your dog as much as you do. But your professional contacts won't be so charitable.

Some cautions. Use Web 2.0 tools too aggressively and it can backfire. While some self-promotion is okay, it's a fine line. You don't want to act like the stereotypical insurance salespeople who are constantly badgering all of their friends to buy more insurance. A good ratio to start at is one blog post directly promoting your consulting career for every ten blog posts that do not.

Be even more cautious about self-promotion on Facebook and LinkedIn. These sites often evolve community standards about what is acceptable and what is not. These standards are often tacit and they can vary greatly across different sites. Even within a Web 2.0 site there is substantial variation on what constitutes excessive self-promotion. The best thing to do is to watch how others behave and emulate them. If someone complains, apologize profusely and publicly. The worst thing you can do is argue, even if the complaint is unfounded. Let others in the community come to your defense if someone tries to enforce a standard more rigid that what the community as a whole prefers.
One final caution is to not spend too much time with Web 2.0 tools. These are usually very cheap and often free, but the trade-off is it takes time to produce information of enduring value. Don't skimp on your time, but you have to place limits, or these efforts will suck away your whole life.

Summary. Web 2.0 tools shouldn't replace more traditional means of promotion, but they can help. If you use Web 2.0, be sure that you make your content focused, fresh, and fun.

Have you used Web 2.0 tools? I'd love to hear what was worked well for you and what hasn't.
